### Baghdad by the Bay Ruby Conf


#### The new, open source, San Francisco Ruby Conference.

##### San Francisco needs a new Ruby Conference.  

FAQ:


Q: What is this?

A: At the 2014 Golden Gate Ruby Conference, the organizers anounced that this year will be the last.  We need a new conference. I would love to organize it, but I can't do it alone. So this is my attempt to get EVERYONE to help.


Q: Can a conference be organized via open source?

A: I don't know. But I'd like to try. 


Q: Do you have the time, money or skill to organize an entire conference?

A: No. I have some of each. But YOU do. All of you. All of you that will help make this happen.


Q: What is the first step?

A: Help plan the planning. Fork this repo, add ideas, lists of things that need to be fleshed out, list of people, skills and projects that will need to be identified to make it a reality.

Q: Do you have a date, venue, name, or really, anything at all?

A: No. But lets figure it out.

Q: A conference can not be run democratically, it will be like design by committee.

A: Agreed. There will need to be one or two primary organizers. I could be one of them, but I don't have to be if someone more qualified was interested. 

Q: What is Baghdad by the Bay?

A: It is one of the nicknames listed on Wikipedia as nicknames for San Francisco (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_city_nicknames_in_California)

Q: What can I do to help?

A: Fork this repo, and help flesh out the details. Seriously.
